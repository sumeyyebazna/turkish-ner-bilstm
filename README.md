# Turkish Named Entity Recognition Using BiLSTM

This project implements a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model for Turkish using a Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) neural network.

## Features

- Loads dataset in CoNLL format  
- Preprocesses and tokenizes data  
- Builds and trains a BiLSTM model  
- Evaluates with precision, recall, and F1-score  
- Visualizes results with confusion matrix and annotated text  

## Setup

Install required packages:

```bash
pip install tensorflow sklearn seqeval matplotlib pandas seaborn
